# MiniWOB demo

Playing with adding some new benchmarks to the OpenAI Mini World of Bits suite.

This currently makes two changes to the published benchmark previews:

* Adds a "reverse text" mode to one of the enter text benchmarks. [Live demo](http://geoffreylitt.com/miniwob/enter-text-2.html)
* Adds a new benchmark asking the user to order the cheapest sandwich from a
  restaurant menu. (This could be easily extended to more tasks related to
  the menu, such as ordering items of different categories, or ordering
  the most expensive item.) [Live demo](http://geoffreylitt.com/miniwob/restaurant-order.html#)
